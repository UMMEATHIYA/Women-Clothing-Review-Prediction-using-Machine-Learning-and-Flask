# Women-Clothing-Review-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Flask
<h3><b>Note:- I have developed this project using python programming language and flask. The Algorithm used is Logistic Regression.</b></h3>
The dataset collected in here is the Womenâ€™s Clothing E-Commerce Reviews which is used as Text Classification and Recommendation Classifier dataset. By entering the reviews for a particular product, the review undergoes the pre-processing and tokenization phases and thus by making analysis predicts whether the product is recommended or not been recommended.
